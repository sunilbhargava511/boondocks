## System Overview

The Boondocks Barbershop booking system implements a **passwordless account management approach** that eliminates the need for traditional user accounts while providing a streamlined booking experience. Instead of requiring users to create accounts with passwords, the system uses email-based identification combined with browser cookies to create a frictionless booking flow.

### Core Concept
- **Guest Booking Flow**: All users book as "guests" without creating traditional accounts
- **Email-Based Identity**: Customer identity is tied to email address only
- **Cookie-Based Persistence**: Browser cookies remember user preferences and enable faster return visits
- **Appointment Ownership**: Customers can view and manage their appointments using only their email address

### Key Features
- No password creation or management required
- Automatic email prefilling for return visitors
- Seamless appointment lookup by email
- Privacy-compliant cookie management
- Cross-session booking continuity

## Cookie Management

The system uses a sophisticated cookie management approach that respects user privacy while enabling functionality.

### Cookie Structure

The system stores a JSON object in the `boondocks_guest_booking` cookie:

```typescript
interface GuestCookieData {
  allowed: boolean;           // Guest booking permission flag
  email?: string;            // User's email for prefilling
  firstSet: string;          // ISO date when cookie was first created
  version: number;           // Cookie schema version for migrations
}
```

### Cookie Properties
- **Name**: `boondocks_guest_booking`
- **Expiry**: 1 year from creation
- **Path**: `/` (site-wide access)
- **SameSite**: `Lax` (prevents CSRF while allowing navigation)
- **Secure**: Enabled on HTTPS connections
- **HttpOnly**: Not set (JavaScript needs access for client-side logic)

### Cookie Manager Features

#### Automatic Detection
```typescript
// Check if user has guest booking enabled
const isAllowed = isGuestBookingAllowed();
const storedEmail = getStoredEmail();
```

#### Smart Prefilling
```typescript
// Auto-fill email on form load
useEffect(() => {
  const storedEmail = getStoredEmail();
  if (storedEmail) {
    setEmail(storedEmail);
  }
}, []);
```

#### Privacy Controls
- Users can view cookie status in footer
- Clear cookie functionality available
- No personal data stored beyond email
- Automatic expiration after 1 year

#### Browser Compatibility
- Cookie availability detection
- Graceful fallback when cookies disabled
- Cross-browser compatibility ensured

### Privacy Compliance

The cookie implementation follows privacy best practices:

1. **Minimal Data**: Only stores essential booking preference
2. **User Control**: Clear privacy notice and cookie clearing option  
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Cookies expire automatically
4. **No Tracking**: No third-party tracking or analytics cookies
5. **Transparent Storage**: Users can see exactly what's stored

## API Endpoints

### Core Booking Endpoints

#### Customer Management

**`POST /api/customers`**
- Creates or updates customer records
- Handles email-based customer identification
- Returns customer object for appointment creation

```typescript
// Request body
{
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
  email: string,
  phone: string,
  notes?: string,
  marketingConsent: boolean,
  smsConsent: boolean
}

// Response
{
  customer: {
    id: string,
    email: string,
    firstName: string,
    lastName: string,
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

**`GET /api/customers/check-email?email={email}`**
- Validates email format
- Checks if customer already exists
- Used for duplicate detection

```typescript
// Response
{
  exists: boolean,
  email: string
}
```

#### Appointment Management

**`POST /api/appointments`**
- Creates new appointments
- Links to customer via email
- Handles conflict detection

**`GET /api/appointments/by-email?email={email}&upcoming={bool}&past={bool}`**
- Retrieves all appointments for an email address
- Supports filtering by upcoming/past appointments
- Central endpoint for appointment management

```typescript
// Response
{
  appointments: Appointment[],
  hasUpcoming: boolean,
  hasPast: boolean,
  customer: Customer
}
```

**`GET /api/appointments/{id}`**
- Retrieves specific appointment details
- Used for appointment modification/cancellation

### Authentication-Free Design

The API design eliminates traditional authentication requirements:

1. **Email as Identity**: All lookups based on email address
2. **No Session Management**: Each request is self-contained
3. **Minimal Security**: Basic email validation only
4. **Public Access**: Most endpoints require only email parameter
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protected by Next.js built-in rate limiting

### Error Handling

Consistent error responses across all endpoints:

```typescript
// Error response format
{
  error: string,          // Human-readable error message
  code?: string,         // Optional error code
  details?: any          // Optional additional context
}
```

Common error scenarios:
- Invalid email format (400)
- Customer not found (404)
- Appointment conflicts (409)
- Server errors (500)

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

The passwordless system addresses several security concerns while introducing some trade-offs:

#### Protected Against
- **Password-based attacks**: No passwords to steal or crack
- **Credential stuffing**: No login credentials to compromise  
- **Password reuse**: Users can't reuse weak passwords
- **Brute force attacks**: No login attempts to target
- **Account lockouts**: No complex account recovery needed

#### Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Email access compromise**: If email is compromised, appointments are accessible
- **Cookie theft**: Malicious scripts could access booking cookies
- **Email enumeration**: System reveals if email has appointments
- **Session fixation**: Cookies persist across browser sessions

### Security Measures Implemented

#### Cookie Security
```typescript
// Secure cookie configuration
document.cookie = `${COOKIE_NAME}=${data}; expires=${expiry}; path=/; SameSite=Lax; Secure=${isHTTPS}`;
```

- **SameSite=Lax**: Prevents CSRF attacks
- **Secure flag**: Enforced on HTTPS connections
- **Controlled expiration**: 1-year automatic cleanup
- **Path restriction**: Limited to application paths

#### Input Validation
```typescript
// Email validation on both client and server
const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
  return { error: 'Invalid email format' };
}
```

- Server-side email format validation
- Client-side input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM
- XSS prevention through React's built-in escaping

#### Data Minimization
- Only essential data stored in cookies
- No sensitive information in client storage
